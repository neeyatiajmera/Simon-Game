# Simon-Game
A fun, interactive game created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery)

# How to play the game
The game consists of 4 buttons each of a different color. The game would randomly flash a button and the user has to follow the pattern. For example, if the game shows the first colour in the sequence as blue, the user clicks on the blue button. Then the game might show the next colour as red. The user has to remember that the sequence is blue, red and so on and so forth.
If the user messes up the sequence, then the game ends.
